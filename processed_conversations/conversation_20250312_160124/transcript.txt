=====================

[Simeon Reyes 00:00:00-00:00:01]: Hey. My patience, sir.

[Mike Shaffer 00:00:01-00:00:02]: Good, good. How are you?

[Simeon Reyes 00:00:03-00:00:18]: Good. Hey, so I was talking to Caitlin, construction manager here at Westport Gateway. So she said that MDS looks like they were able to rewire the fixtures, these retrofits for us for a similar project.

[Mike Shaffer 00:00:18-00:00:19]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:00:19-00:00:21]: Make them Title 24 compliant.

[Mike Shaffer 00:00:21-00:00:24]: Okay, cool. So they. They're. They're.

[Simeon Reyes 00:00:24-00:00:35]: Which is. Yeah. So if you could price everything. I know it's prelim right now, and then when we go to final, we could obviously do more research.

[Mike Shaffer 00:00:36-00:00:36]: Yeah.

[Simeon Reyes 00:00:36-00:00:52]: But from you. So the base bid, I guess we need to include to make these Title 24 compliant the existing fixtures without having to add any fixtures. So you know that open area, it says six fixtures instead of nine.

[Mike Shaffer 00:00:53-00:00:53]: Right.

[Simeon Reyes 00:00:53-00:01:02]: So assuming we keep those as is, just give me a price and include in the base bid to make these Title 24 complaint.

[Mike Shaffer 00:01:02-00:01:02]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:01:02-00:01:11]: So rewire or do whatever you got to do. And then the alternate will be to. To basically upgrade the light fixtures and switches and controls.

[Mike Shaffer 00:01:11-00:01:19]: Okay. So the. Just so I'm clear on counts, the base bit is going to be to rewire the existing six.

[Simeon Reyes 00:01:20-00:01:23]: It'll be the whole. There have. It would have to be their whole space, Right?

[Mike Shaffer 00:01:23-00:01:23]: Right.

[Simeon Reyes 00:01:23-00:01:24]: Technically, yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:01:25-00:01:28]: But there's only six in the open space right now.

[Simeon Reyes 00:01:28-00:01:56]: Correct. So whatever you see two by fours, deduct three. Right. That'll be the physical actual count and then I'll double check. I think there's a three down lights, but those I don't think they will retrofit. So most likely we have to do something with those. I'm sure we have to read through those. The sound lights in front of the pantry and their IT room. I could pull up their old plan. Last time we did it with you guys when we did their. Because when we did a little rework for them.

[Mike Shaffer 00:01:56-00:02:28]: Yeah, I'm trying to pull up the plan right now. So I have it in front of me while we're talking, but my wi fi doesn't seem to be working. There we go. All right, so the alt is to replace all the existing lights we're not at. So just to be clear, there's six there and we're leaving six, Right. There's no situation where there's going to be nine on the.

[Simeon Reyes 00:02:28-00:02:34]: On the alts. Let's do the nine. Okay. So we can match the layout and the.

[Mike Shaffer 00:02:34-00:02:35]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:02:35-00:02:37]: And the specs.

[Mike Shaffer 00:02:41-00:02:59]: Okay. I think this is the plan. All right, cool. How's the plan? Finally.

[Simeon Reyes 00:03:02-00:03:05]: So let me putting up the old door chest.

[Mike Shaffer 00:03:05-00:03:08]: Oh, I see. Damn. This is.

[Simeon Reyes 00:03:10-00:03:21]: Last time when we did this Last job was there was 20, 21 pulling up the plan for that one.

[Mike Shaffer 00:03:24-00:03:29]: So there's this. God, sorry. Okay, so this is completely different than the last one.

[Simeon Reyes 00:03:30-00:03:35]: Yeah, yeah, the last one we were giving back face. Now they're taking that space back.

[Mike Shaffer 00:03:35-00:03:46]: No, even from like the last. From what I understood on the demo or on the original time you sent the plans over. I didn't realize. Yeah, I didn't realize. Okay, now I'm starting to see it all.

[Simeon Reyes 00:03:47-00:04:00]: Yeah. So we're basically. They gave back that space before and now they're taking it back. But since they gave it back, you did all new finishes on that. So now we've stuck with two sets of like new and old.

[Mike Shaffer 00:04:03-00:04:27]: Okay. So the entire new base bid is going to include rewiring those six existing lights in the. In the space. And then. So right now my bid is going to have those 3, 6, 9, 12, the 15 from the not great area, plus those 6. Right. So it's gonna be 21 lights for the base bid.

[Simeon Reyes 00:04:29-00:04:45]: The ones in the expansion are already 2x4 focal point LEDs. So the. And the ones in the white space. So those. All we need to do is integrate to that other split to the. Exist to the gray area.

[Mike Shaffer 00:04:45-00:04:49]: Yeah. So for the, for the, for the base bid, we just need to wire it. All right.

[Simeon Reyes 00:04:50-00:05:00]: Basically. Yeah. So for your base bid, you have safe off, obviously you have integration. And then rewire the existing space to make those title 24.

[Mike Shaffer 00:05:00-00:05:11]: Right. And then for the alternate, we're going to replace those six lights with nine lights. Yeah.

[Simeon Reyes 00:05:11-00:05:14]: And then replace. So basically replace all the fixtures in the gray area.

[Mike Shaffer 00:05:14-00:05:21]: Okay. Just the gray, the gray. Clouded. Clouded area.

[Simeon Reyes 00:05:22-00:05:31]: Yeah, they have exit signs there too. So we would have to. And I don't know if we need to add any more exit signs per code for the new layout.

[Mike Shaffer 00:05:31-00:05:37]: Depends on where the existing ones are. It should be okay though.

[Simeon Reyes 00:05:40-00:05:56]: Yeah. So we have two round down lights in front of their existing IT room and copy room, whatever those things are, those round down lights. So we have to upgrade. Upgrade those two. How do you do those? I don't even know. Those are demo. You would have to try to replace those two, huh?

[Mike Shaffer 00:05:56-00:06:00]: Yeah, we would have to replace them. And more likely with square. Right?

[Simeon Reyes 00:06:01-00:06:15]: Yeah, because I'm looking at their existing space. Let me see if they're gonna send you this for your record. Yeah. So they show the wall washers, right. You see those ones that look like half moons or whatever in those corner offices right and left? Those are wall walkers.

[Mike Shaffer 00:06:16-00:06:18]: Conference room 1253.

[Simeon Reyes 00:06:20-00:06:27]: No, not that one. I'm talking about in the gray area. In the gray area, upper right and upper left.

[Mike Shaffer 00:06:27-00:06:30]: Oh yeah. It's the same symbol, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Simeon Reyes 00:06:30-00:06:41]: So those are existing and those. I'm sure the ones in the open area is. I mean the ones in the white area, those. Everything there is LEDs, but the one in the gray, everything there is like the old fluorescent or whatever they are.

[Mike Shaffer 00:06:42-00:06:51]: So we need to. So it's not just the. It's not just the. The red crowded clouded box. We're doing the whole space. Yeah.

[Simeon Reyes 00:06:51-00:06:55]: Because I'm sure we have to get. And we have to do Title 24. We have to do everything right.

[Mike Shaffer 00:06:55-00:06:56]: Right. Yeah.

[Simeon Reyes 00:06:57-00:06:57]: Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:06:57-00:06:59]: Oh, wow. This is a much bigger job than.

[Simeon Reyes 00:06:59-00:07:11]: It started as I know. And I'm telling you the customer has 50, 000 allowance, which is crazy. I don't know what they're gonna do. I mean they're gonna have to do the rewire because we have to be title 24 for sure. So.

[Mike Shaffer 00:07:11-00:07:12]: Right.

[Simeon Reyes 00:07:12-00:07:17]: I'm hoping that's obviously that should be cheaper than upgrading all the lights and Lutron and all that. No.

[Mike Shaffer 00:07:17-00:07:20]: Oh, just. Yeah. Just adding the control wire.

[Simeon Reyes 00:07:21-00:07:21]: Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:07:21-00:07:22]: Yeah, for sure.

[Simeon Reyes 00:07:23-00:07:32]: Because then if we have to redo the lights, we have to get. Because these are those retrofits and those are two by two openings. We have to do acoustical and this.

[Mike Shaffer 00:07:32-00:07:34]: Oh God. Okay. I see.

[Simeon Reyes 00:07:35-00:07:43]: Yeah. So we're trying to see. So hopefully when they go with the. I'm hoping they go with the. Just rewiring. And we're gonna do all new lights to it.

[Mike Shaffer 00:07:44-00:07:46]: Right. I see now.

[Simeon Reyes 00:07:49-00:07:59]: Washers and two down lights. But how do you do those? With the worry wiring option? I don't even think that's an option to rewire those. Right. If those were not technically retrofitted.

[Mike Shaffer 00:07:59-00:08:01]: Oh, we. We would just have. I mean like the.

[Simeon Reyes 00:08:01-00:08:03]: You can find the retrofits fixture.

[Mike Shaffer 00:08:03-00:08:07]: No, I. This is T bar over here. It's all two by fours.

[Simeon Reyes 00:08:08-00:08:08]: Two.

[Mike Shaffer 00:08:09-00:08:23]: But yeah. I think we would just have to replace the whole fixture and just, you know, new tile and new fixture just go with the square, I think. So what side do you know the size on these insert like 4 1/2.

[Simeon Reyes 00:08:23-00:08:27]: Inch or 5 inch round down lights because it's.

[Mike Shaffer 00:08:28-00:08:34]: It's not that much more to get a new fixture for something like this. But I guess they are penny pinching like crazy, huh?

[Simeon Reyes 00:08:35-00:08:44]: Yeah. I mean he seems like. He's like, eh, just price it. Just price it. But he still. Customers at the end of the day is gonna Want to just have the cheapest option possible.

[Mike Shaffer 00:08:44-00:09:06]: Right. Trying to look at these existing. Existing images. Okay. This is the space. This is the current. Current space has the. The right two by fours in it, right?

[Simeon Reyes 00:09:06-00:09:21]: Correct. And that has the green walls and it's the new. And that one has the optimal ceiling tile, which is newer. The other space has the gold S tiles too, which. That's another thing. Up to see if they want to upgrade all their ceiling tiles.

[Mike Shaffer 00:09:21-00:09:29]: I see. I'm in. What are their controls look like?

[Simeon Reyes 00:09:30-00:09:34]: The controls are those wall sensors and those older.

[Mike Shaffer 00:09:38-00:09:43]: We'll probably have to. We'll end up switching those out for Lutron dimmers. I think just.

[Simeon Reyes 00:09:44-00:09:45]: Do you think so?

[Mike Shaffer 00:09:45-00:09:49]: Well, we have to switch them out. They have to be dimmable. And those aren't dimmers.

[Simeon Reyes 00:09:51-00:09:54]: Because I think Caitlin thought that the mds.

[Mike Shaffer 00:09:56-00:10:02]: The lights are okay, but the dimme. There's no dimmers. We need a dimmer switch. You know what I mean?

[Simeon Reyes 00:10:02-00:10:03]: Right.

[Mike Shaffer 00:10:04-00:10:10]: I see. I finally see two of the down lights now in the. But they're in the hallway.

[Simeon Reyes 00:10:11-00:10:11]: Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:10:15-00:10:24]: Yeah. I mean, they make LED retrofits for those types of fixtures. But is that really what we want to do?

[Simeon Reyes 00:10:24-00:10:28]: Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, you saw the down lights too.

[Mike Shaffer 00:10:28-00:10:44]: Yeah. I mean, what do you. There's only like three, four lights that you're gonna. You're gonna end up saving 400 bucks, you know what I mean? To not have the building standard. It seems to me like a. We should probably do the building standard. But.

[Simeon Reyes 00:10:45-00:10:46]: Right.

[Mike Shaffer 00:10:48-00:10:50]: But I don't know, man. I just work here.

[Simeon Reyes 00:10:50-00:10:57]: What about the exit signs? So there's two of those older exit signs there too. And then alternate. We should upgr thing up, including the exit signs?

[Mike Shaffer 00:10:57-00:10:58]: I think so.

[Simeon Reyes 00:10:59-00:11:06]: Yeah. Include those two exit signs in the. In the alternate. But what about the base? Are those Title 24 compliant? Does it matter for exit signs?

[Mike Shaffer 00:11:07-00:11:08]: Exit signs are fine.

[Simeon Reyes 00:11:09-00:11:12]: So let's keep them in the base bid. If you're rewiring.

[Mike Shaffer 00:11:12-00:11:13]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:11:13-00:11:19]: Let's include new for. For the. For the alternate.

[Mike Shaffer 00:11:19-00:11:21]: Okay. New exits in the alternate.

[Simeon Reyes 00:11:22-00:11:23]: Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:11:23-00:11:25]: And I think it's just like the two. Right?

[Simeon Reyes 00:11:25-00:11:27]: Yeah, it's just two in the existing space.

[Mike Shaffer 00:11:36-00:11:50]: All right. I think, just so I'm clear, my whole estimate now is going to include rewiring the entire space for title 24.

[Simeon Reyes 00:11:52-00:11:54]: Entire grayed out area. Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:11:54-00:12:09]: Yeah. Replacing those four down lights. Or is it six? It's. It's gonna be six new downlight. Yeah. Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:12:11-00:12:13]: And then you're safe up for the.

[Mike Shaffer 00:12:13-00:12:20]: Demo that we're doing safe off and rewire. And then. Is that a furniture feed?

[Simeon Reyes 00:12:21-00:12:25]: Yeah, I believe that's a furniture feed in that. By the way, the brick room is.

[Mike Shaffer 00:12:25-00:12:26]: Yeah.

[Simeon Reyes 00:12:28-00:12:33]: And then they have a. I think it's an alternate for the floor monument. Give me one second.

[Mike Shaffer 00:12:33-00:12:36]: Yeah, Yeah, I saw that alternate. Alternate.

[Simeon Reyes 00:12:40-00:12:41]: It.

[Mike Shaffer 00:13:23-00:13:24]: Yep.

[Simeon Reyes 00:13:26-00:13:36]: Yes. So whatever plan price it. The only thing we're adding is obviously all this rewiring and those added down lights and washers or whatever.

[Mike Shaffer 00:13:36-00:13:49]: Yeah. Okay, I. I think I have. I think I have it all understood now. So in the base, we're just planning to leave the. The mismatch fixtures.

[Simeon Reyes 00:13:51-00:13:53]: Yeah, legal mismatch fixtures, which is re.

[Mike Shaffer 00:13:54-00:14:12]: Rewiring everything and replacing the. The down lights and. Okay. And then the regular electrical. And then the. The alternate is going to be to point two by fours throughout the gray space.

[Simeon Reyes 00:14:12-00:14:13]: Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:14:14-00:14:16]: And adding those three. Basically.

[Simeon Reyes 00:14:18-00:14:19]: Whatever you gotta do.

[Mike Shaffer 00:14:19-00:14:35]: Yeah. Oh, and then. Yeah, we're gonna. I mean, shit, we're gonna have to add office controls for all of the offices to get the dimming. Okay. Yeah, it's everything but the light fixtures. Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:14:36-00:14:47]: Yeah. And I'll get it. I'll get the cost from the acoustical guys for the alternate to shoot new wire and rework the openings and all.

[Mike Shaffer 00:14:47-00:15:07]: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. For the. For the alternate, the alternate to replace them all. Make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Yeah, it says it's got all the old switches and stuff. All right.

[Simeon Reyes 00:15:08-00:15:17]: To do a vestibule. A double door vestibule at the. Where they're. That entry door at 1255. That. The newer set. Newer area.

[Mike Shaffer 00:15:17-00:15:20]: Okay. I think I see the note for it like three point B or something.

[Simeon Reyes 00:15:20-00:15:29]: Yeah. So they're gonna want that. So they want card reader assembly and door mags. So I think you have to do back boxes for all that.

[Mike Shaffer 00:15:29-00:15:30]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:15:31-00:15:35]: The conduits for the hinge and the. And the car reader.

[Mike Shaffer 00:15:36-00:15:41]: Yeah, Double door. Double door. Right.

[Simeon Reyes 00:15:41-00:15:42]: Yeah.

[Mike Shaffer 00:15:42-00:15:45]: So two door mags to.

[Simeon Reyes 00:15:45-00:15:45]: Right.

[Mike Shaffer 00:15:48-00:15:58]: Okay. I think that's everything. And we're demo. We're demoing that floor core to move it over 2ft or 6 inches or something.

[Simeon Reyes 00:15:58-00:16:01]: I think that one gets moved. Right, the one in the.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:01-00:16:02]: The conference room.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:02-00:16:07]: Yeah, conference room. Yeah. So custom safe up. That'll be part of your safe up, I guess.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:07-00:16:07]: And then.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:08-00:16:11]: Boring. And make sure you include X ray or sonar, whatever you need to do.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:11-00:16:12]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:13-00:16:18]: That's in the base bit because there's been too many. Pinnacle.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:18-00:16:21]: Yeah, pinnacle, man.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:21-00:16:24]: I know how to kill it for everybody.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:29-00:16:32]: Okay, I'll put this together and get it back to you today.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:32-00:16:39]: Cool. Appreciate it, man. And I'm gonna send you another quick pricing for. That's for a customer direct over there at 2121.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:39-00:16:40]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:41-00:16:44]: To add card reader assemblies.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:44-00:16:45]: Okay.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:45-00:16:47]: At two doors, at a double door and a single door.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:47-00:16:48]: Cool.

[Simeon Reyes 00:16:48-00:16:53]: And then TV. Two TV locations. So power data. TV power data.

[Mike Shaffer 00:16:53-00:17:00]: Okay. So two TV power datas and two card readers. Yeah, you got it. It'd be like 1600 to two grand.

[Simeon Reyes 00:17:01-00:17:02]: Yeah, make that per minute, too.

[Mike Shaffer 00:17:02-00:17:03]: Okay, cool.

[Simeon Reyes 00:17:04-00:17:07]: Make sure we're good to go, but I'll send you some pictures, and I'll send you that floor plan.

[Mike Shaffer 00:17:08-00:17:09]: Sounds good.

[Simeon Reyes 00:17:09-00:17:10]: Thank you, sir.

[Mike Shaffer 00:17:10-00:17:12]: Thank you, man. All right, bye.
